# Human Input Market (HIM)

A prediction-market-powered survey platform where users **vote** (expressing
genuine belief) and **bet credits** (predicting what the crowd will choose) —
all stored on-chain as transaction memos.

See [HUMAN_INPUT_MARKET_SPEC.md](HUMAN_INPUT_MARKET_SPEC.md) for the full
product spec.
